title: Time as structure in disruptive innovation
date: 2024-04-18T11:02:06.233Z
location: Göttingen
abstract: "The second meeting will be held at Georg-August-University Göttingen
  and center around the time-as-structure lens in disruptive innovation with a
  particular focus on temporal patterns and temporal orientations. Building on
  the idea that disruptive innovations erupt temporal structures, and that the
  role of temporal structures becomes particularly visible when coordinating
  such innovation activities, the guiding question of this meeting is: How do
  actors engage in temporal brokering, navigate, and coordinate multiple,
  potentially conflicting temporal patterns and orientations in disruptive
  innovation processes?"
