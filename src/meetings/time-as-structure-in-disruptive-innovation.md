title: Time as structure in disruptive innovation
date: 2024-04-18T11:02:06.233Z
endDate: 2024-04-19T15:33:37.224Z
location: Göttingen
abstract: "The second meeting will be held at Georg-August-University Göttingen
  and center around the time-as-structure lens in disruptive innovation with a
  particular focus on temporal patterns and temporal orientations. Building on
  the idea that disruptive innovations erupt temporal structures, and that the
  role of temporal structures becomes particularly visible when coordinating
  such innovation activities, the guiding question of this meeting is: How do
  actors engage in temporal brokering, navigate, and coordinate multiple,
  potentially conflicting temporal patterns and orientations in disruptive
  innovation processes?"

Building on the idea that disruptive innovations erupt temporal structures, and that the role of temporal structures becomes particularly visible when coordinating such innovation activities, the guiding question of this meeting is: How do actors engage in temporal brokering, navigate, and coordinate multiple, potentially conflicting temporal patterns and orientations in disruptive innovation processes?

We plan several interactive session to discuss theoretical and methodological challenges of ongoing research projects of our network members as well as keynotes, a field trip and a social event.

Keynotes: Charlene Zietsma, Patrizia Klarner
