  The second meeting was held at Georg-August-University Göttingen and center
  around the question: "How do actors engage in temporal brokering, navigate,
  and coordinate multiple, potentially conflicting temporal patterns and
  orientations in disruptive innovation processes?"


  This meeting focussed on active engagement with ongoing research projects of network members and featured a field trip to Forum Wissen. Klick here to find out more.

The second meeting was held at Georg-August-University Göttingen and centered around the time-as-structure lens in disruptive innovation with a particular focus on temporal patterns and temporal orientations. Building on the idea that disruptive innovations erupt temporal structures, and that the role of temporal structures becomes particularly visible when coordinating such innovation activities, the guiding question of this meeting was: How do actors engage in temporal brokering, navigate, and coordinate multiple, potentially conflicting temporal patterns and orientations in disruptive innovation processes?

In several interactive sessions,  we discussed theoretical and methodological challenges of ongoing research projects of our network members. Our lively discussion was further facilitated by inspiring keynotes by Charlene Zietsma on *Temporal Discordances in Disruptive Innovation* and Patricia Klarner on *Developments in Temporality Research and Outlooks on the Field—Where are we going?*

To bring forward the network-element of our research network, we took a tour around the famous "Stadtwall", went on a scavenger hunt through Göttingen to identify elements of temporality, disruption and innovation within the city, and visited [Forum Wissen Göttingen](https://www.forum-wissen.de/), a museum on the facets of scientific processes. Fittingly, this museum portrayed "waiting" as key element of the research process, nicely linking the process of how we conduct research to temporarlity—which is also the content of our research.
