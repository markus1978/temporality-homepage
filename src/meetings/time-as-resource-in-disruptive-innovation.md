location: St. Gallen
abstract: "The third meeting will focus on the role oftime-as- resource that can
  be leveraged both to support and thwart disruptive innovation. Thereby the
  concepts of timing and pacing are of particular importance. The guiding
  question for this meeting is: How do actors leverage timing and pacing as
  temporal resources to navigate challenges entailed in disruptive innovation? A
  focus will be on speed-based approaches to organizing disruptive innovation,
  such as innovation accelerators. We will also explore “slow innovation” as an
  alternative to the dominant regime of acceleration."
