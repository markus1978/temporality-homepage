title: Time as resource in disruptive innovation

abstract: "The third meeting focussed on the role of time-as- resource that can
  be leveraged both to support and thwart disruptive innovation. Thereby the
  concepts of timing and pacing are of particular importance. The guiding
  question for this meeting was: How do actors leverage timing and pacing as
  temporal resources to navigate challenges entailed in disruptive innovation?
  We will also explore “slow innovation” as an alternative to the dominant
  regime of acceleration."

This time, we met at the University of St. Gallen (HSG) to discuss time as a resource for disruptive innovations. However, the focus was not limited to the commonly competitive notion that faster innovation equates to better innovation. Instead, with Marc Steen's kick-off session, we explored the opposite perspective, discussing the qualitative characteristics that emerge through slow innovation. The day continued with two exciting Paper Development Workshops, which provided insights into the work of network members and allowed for collaborative development of their ideas.

 

The second day began with a keynote by Ann-Kristin Zobel, who introduced us to her study on open innovation. She enriched the discussion by presenting an engaging empirical case study that illustrated the temporal dimension of collaborative innovation.

 

We also had the pleasure of welcoming Jürg Weibel, who presented *Zeitvorsorge*, a socially oriented initiative. The idea behind it is to create a time bank where individuals can accumulate hours by spending time with primarily elderly people, which they can redeem later when they might need someone to spend time with them. With *Zeitvorsorge*, time literally becomes a resource, adding a practical example to our theoretical discussions.

 

The program was rounded out with cultural activities, including an art tour focusing on the architecture and art collection at the University of St. Gallen, as well as a city tour of St. Gallen. Thus, as a network, we not only enjoyed meaningful exchanges but also engaged with the place where we stayed at during the meeting.
